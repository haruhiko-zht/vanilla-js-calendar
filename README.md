vanilla js calendar

This js calendar was created for my studying in 2019, so this calendar is not maintenance.

## Demo

Sample image when developing.

![overview](./example/sample_image/overview.png)

![schedule-detail](./example/sample_image/schedule-detail.png)

![create-schedule](./example/sample_image/create-schedule.png)

![another-overview](./example/sample_image/another-overview.png)

## Requirement

- Moment.js  
  'Moment.js' is ending development, so you should use other datetime js library.  
  I think 'Day.js' is similar 'Moment.js'.
